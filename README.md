remix routing testing
This is the tutorial form remixrun that i did several times. It is because the feautures that they included entirely,
is too modern. Standalone applicatin in the browser is possible. Loader, Action, Navlinks. Fetcher, Prefetch and remix+react `s
hooks work behind the scence.  Only adding 3-5 line of code give you some UI/UX issue fixed than other framework do.
